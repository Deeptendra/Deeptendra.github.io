                        <p>Conducted an analytical project to estimate the Engel Curve for Meghalaya's population using data from the NSS 68<sup>th</sup> Survey on Consumer Expenditure. The project utilized household expenditure as a proxy for income to model and assess the relationship between income and expenditure across various categories of goods and services. The derived Engel curves covered diverse product groups, including cereals, fruits, vegetables, spices, clothing, footwear, fuel and light, medical expenses, entertainment, and durable goods.</p>

                        <p class="project-instructor">Instructor: Arnab Chakraborty</p>
                        <p>Developed an onset detection algorithm for audio recordings, utilizing short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and spectrogram analysis. The algorithm involved preprocessing audio signals, dividing them into overlapping frames, applying the Hann windowing function, and computing the STFT to produce a magnitude spectrogram. Spectral flux was calculated to identify changes in spectral content, followed by a thresholding approach to detect sound event onsets. An optional clustering step was incorporated to mitigate over-detection of onsets.</p>
